AMILAB:

 * It seems that trying to compile with static wxwidgets fails ...
   the binary stays blocked !!!

Cross-compiling with Boost and cmake:

Cross-compiling boost:
- different problems:
  * disable some of the directories by replacing CMakeLists.txt by
      CMakeLists.txt.bak in them:
      ./libs/wave/CMakeLists.txt.bak
      ./libs/graph/CMakeLists.txt.bak
      
  * set the zlib and bzip2 lib libraries in the advanced view of cmake
  
  * When running the "make install" command, it asks for subdirectories
      /include/boost 
    to fix it comment the lines
      # Install this module's headers
      #install(DIRECTORY include/boost 
      #  DESTINATION ${BOOST_HEADER_DIR}
      #  COMPONENT ${libname}_headers
      #  PATTERN "CVS" EXCLUDE
      #  PATTERN ".svn" EXCLUDE)
  in the file tools/build/CMake/BoostCore.cmake

  * After make install the statics libraries start with liblib instead of lib
    and the FindBoost.cmake file finds the dynamic libraries,
    so a fast solution is to delete the dynamic libraries and rename the static
    ones that are needed with only one lib prefix.

  * when compiling amilab, to find the boost libraries, the variable
      Boost_COMPILER needs to be set (I am not sure why), using
    ccmake . -DBoost_COMPILER=-gcc43
    set the BOOST_ROOT directory
