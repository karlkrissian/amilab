libAMIOpticalFlow
installation:

this library is only made of header files:
template C++ code.

To install, 
copy the full directory 
include/OpticFlow in your installation directory,
for example (as root on linux):
cp -R include/OpticalFlow /usr/local/include/

Later to compile with this library and cmake,
you will need to specify the directory where the files 
have been extracted.

enjoy!
