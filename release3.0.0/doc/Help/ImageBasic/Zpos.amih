token(s):
T_Zpos Zpos

rule(s):
image -> T_Zpos( VAR_IMAGE )

description:
Creates an new USHORT image that contains
the Z coordinates of the given image.
This can be very useful for arithmetic
operations on images.

Example(s):
- Putting the image borders in Z coordinates at 0:

z = Zpos(i)
i = i*(z>2)*(z<i.tz-3)
